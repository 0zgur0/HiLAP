{'reviews': ['They make a plan, for your mouth to get healthy & stay healthy! Wonderful service.', "I have extreme anxiety when it comes to the dentist. I had a really bad experience with my childhood dentist. This made it so when I was an adult I didn't go as often and I should have. I moved to Ahwatukee 9 years ago and a friend recommended this office to me.  I've been going regulalry for routine cleaning since. I went last month for a cleaning and found out I needed a crown. Sensing my anxiety he assured me I would be fine. I scheduled my appt. for today. I went in so nervous I wanted to leave.  He came in, explaining everything he would be doing.  He put me at ease and I've never felt better. I would highly recommend Dr. Kode to anyone looking for a dentist. He's restored my faith in dentists. I will go back in a few weeks for the permanent crown and I'm not a bit nervous about it. Thank you so much for your patience with me and the absolute best experience I've had from a dentist.", "I've only been here once but my husband has been going for a while and I plan to obviously continue. I'm a complete wimp at the dentist and they were pretty great. The staff is friendly and relaxed, which helps. They have been very honest and the fancy office and TV's are just the icing on top. I would recommend any of my family or friends here!!", 'Great experience with the hygenists and pediatric dentist! Clean office, good with kids and timely. The dentist was great. We didnt get the feeling of being "upsold" like other practices. The staff was friendly enough. \n\nWe will definitely be back!', "My husband and I went to this dentist as a recommendation from my sister-in-law.  My husband and I went as we were not happy with our current dentsit.  What a blessing!  We both went and they worked on both of us and did our work that we needed that day!  My husband needed a veneer\\/crown with no scheduling down the road because of finances. I had priced the crown and the out of pocket cost and this office was 1\\/2 of what I was quoted from many different offices in the area.   We have great dental insurance which has never been an issue but they were concerned about us and not $$$$$.  I appreciate that.  Everyone in the office was super nice.  I went into the office the next day to get 3 fillings and everyone came by to ask how my husband was and how he liked his work.  I don't know about anyone else but I will pay extra for great customer service.  Here you get the most caring staff and you can understand why when you meet the dentist, Dentist Kobe.  He is great at his craft and he sincerely cares about you.  God has blessed him and us by introducing us.  I highly recommend this dental office to anyone looking for a dentist in the Phoenix area.", 'Recently called Dental By Design because I was recommended by two different people to go and check them out. I called twice and was told they would call me back to schedule my appointment, no call back. Horrible service.', "Dr. Curry has been my dentist for almost 12 years now. She's the definition of awesomeness. AND everyone there always has a smile! Thanks so much", 'Very nice staff   Gentle Hygienist.  I love the fact that they will call you to schedule an appointment when they have cancellations that might work for you.  Off the top of my head, I can\'t recall that lady\'s name that calls from the office all the time, but I just heart her!  She is such a gem.  \n\nI\'ve been to dental offices that are far more technologically advanced with headphones, satellite TV, computer applications that the staff uses to show and explain what\'s going on with your teeth.  Since I\'m an engineer, I love gadgets and tech stuff.  \n \nIn addition, the main reason I did not give this place a four is the fact that I have to ask "what is that instrument used to detect?", "what does that tell us?",  "what does that mean?".  I absolutely detest going to an office where I\'m paying you to do work for me and I leave there not understanding what you did for me.  So, every time I"ve been to this office, I ask those questions.  I don\'t like it.  the information should flow freely.  It helps when your patient is informed and can make better decisions.  \n\nAll-in-All, I enjoy my visits here.', "This place is dishonest and I would never recommend anyone I know to go there. They tried to make me feel bad about my teeth in order to pressure me into their services. They were rude and tried to take advantage of me. They lied to me and said I had multiple cavities which I don't according to the dentist I go to now. They had a really nice office and equipment but I wasn't going to pay that for them. I'm going to pay someone to be honest with me and to take good care of my teeth, not just look at what's in my wallet.", "I am not giving them one star based on their work but I up front told them that I had 2000 left on my insurance and 3 days to use it but I was limited on money in the future and wanted to be sure that after the 3 days that I was all paid up. I would pay daily for what the insurance didn't cover. They called the insurance everyday and told me what it would cost for the work that day which I paid in full everyday. The final day I paid them and made sure I owed them nothing and they said I'm all paid up. Then months later they claim I owe them over $300 and after talking to the insurance company they claimed the dentist got a quote on one thing but charged them for something different. Well how is that my fault they knew i was not going to be able to pay a bill later yet they screwed up and charged me for it and now they are giving me bad credit over something that I had no control over. Now had the lady at the desk who called my insurance know what to ask the insurance company I would have gladly paid what I needed to that day. You do not dock the customers for your screw ups and that is not how a business keeps customers. I would recommend looking else where unless you too want to be billed for their incompetence. There are plenty of dentists that will not try to pull the wool over your eyes. Tell you one thing but mean another.", "Dr Kahn and Misty were very clear and explained everything for me. It was a super friendly environment. I'll definitely be making this my dentist.", 'WOW, all they want is $$$$$$$. I sure don\'t mind to pay for what I need but trying to squeeze more money from our insurance AND extra from patient? Not cool! Their rates are much more than most places and their dental chair office is like an assembly line. Horrible experiences and when issues were brought up, they talk down on you or act like it was a "mistype" error.\nI would not recommend this place if it was the last dental office on earth.\nExpensive, overpriced, low quality of work and sanitary.', "Going to the dentist office has always been a source of anguish for me, ever since I was young. Perhaps due to some of the abnormal experiences I had gone through up until now. Not having insurance or being covered by my parents plan. As a result of growing up close to the boarder I often made trips to Mexico for my dentistry work.\n\nMy friend who works there suggested I'd come in for a cleaning and after a few months of reluctancy I finally decided to make an appointment. In all honestly I was visibly uncomfortable which was largely due to the lapse of time between visits.\n\nHowever, Dental By Design made every effort to make me feel as calm and comfortable as possible. The office itself is very clean, the front line were all amazingly nice, pleasant and helpful. They worked with my budget because at the time I was uninsured and I was able to fit into a payment plan that worked best for me.\n\nI'm not sure if bed side manner is a term associated with dentistry but Dr. Curry handled me with care. She spoke me all the through my assessment and made sure I understood her, outlining steps to make moving forward.\n\nI can't say I'll look forward to the dentist again, but I will say I look forward to being in a welcoming, knowledgeable, and safe atmosphere again with individuals who do great work.", 'I live 24 miles away but still come back for Dr. Kode and his lovely assistants.  This place does it all.  Friendly, latest technology, all levels of service and has great office systems\\/processes in place.  They even will provide you a rating of your teeth from 1 to 100, but you have to ask for it.  Keep up the good work Dental by Design.', 'I have been seeing Dr Kode since he took over the practice. Have never met a more knowledgeable professional with such great bedside or chair-side manner. He is also a great community member.', "Just like most people, I dislike going to the dentist, but I've been going to Dental by Design for over a year and recently got a crown done. It was fair in price and things went very well through the entire experience. The staff is very friendly and professional and they get you in and out at your set appointment time.", "This dental office is one of the best that I have ever been to. When I first moved to the Phoenix area, I probably tried out about 8 different dentists before finally listening to my co-worker's referral and coming here. Dr. Kode is an awesome dentist. He is highly skilled, and uses up-to-date high tech equipment. Marianne is also the best dental hygienists that I have had. She is thorough, gentle, and very knowledgeable about everything!!! She is also a perfectionist, which I can appreciate-being one myself, and never misses anything. Sheryl, Sandy, and Heather are also fantastic, and always friendly! I don't know the rest of the staff as well, but everyone has always been overly nice. \n\nIn addition to being extremely competent, this dental office is also very patient-oriented. They have events (like movie nights) for patients, and always have really cool giveaways. They are also involved in community events and charity work. \n\nMoreover, they are also very compassionate and considerate of patients who do not have dental insurance. They are very reasonably priced, which is rare for this quality of service. \n\nI moved to California for school almost 2 years ago, but I am still driving to Arizona twice a year just to see these guys! They are totally worth it! I tried out a dentist in California who charged me twice as much for a cleaning and did a horrible job. Being in graduate school, I don't have time or money for trial-and-error dentists, and it's good to know that this office is there for me, even though I have to drive about 350 miles to get there. :)\n\nThank you!!!", 'Our family has been going to Dr.Kode even before he formed Dental by Design, over 10 years now. He\'s been there for us through all our family dental "fun"; from the headgear and braces to the wisdom teeth and deep tissue cleaning. He\'s done it all.  His staff from the front desk (shout out to Sandy) to the everyone behind the scenes like his best hygienist, MaryAnn take care of our family like we\'re one of their own. Face it, no one likes going to the dentist. But Dental by Design has made the experience a pleasant one. It\'s also very apparent that they appreciate their patients, as they are always holding events and contests to thank them.\nThank you, Dr,Kode and Dental by Design for making my teeth and my family\'s teeth shine :)', 'Been going to Dr. Kode for 7 years now. Very competent and capable dentist, great problem solver and great communicator.  Love his staff - Laci is Da Bomb!\n\nAnd... this is coming from the son of a Dentist!', 'Thereza Wright is the best hygienist ive had the pleasure of working with. She is along with the rest of the staff is awesome, understanding, patient and friendly. They have superior service and down to earth vibes in the office putting you at ease when you are sitting in the chair. Going to the dentist has never been easier when you go to these guys and get handled by the team that works there.', 'I have been going here for 5 years now. The staff is always so friendly and there is always a cold water for you to help yourself to. The confirmation process is so convenient because it is texted and emailed to me. Dr. Kode is a licensed Invisalign dentist so I did Invisalign. He did a wonderful job. I have so much more self confidence now. He even threw in an ipad and free teeth whitening. They always do a great job!', "2 bad experiences I thought I would give them the benefit of the doubt but I actually really hated it. I felt like they wanted my money but the work I had done was shoddy. If you want the experience of a used car dealership with the feeling of just being a number like at the DMV. Try it you may like it. Not for me especially since there is a dentist practically on every corner I don't have to settle.", 'Dr. Kode has been my dentist for about 6 years.  As well as receiving my dental check ups and care from him, I also did the Invisalign program with him with great success.  His staff is very personable, his office is clean and appointments are always handled professionally.  Dr Kode is very knowledgable, personable, kind and gentle with all of his treatments.  I have recommended him and his staff to several friends and would recommend them to anyone looking for dentist in the Ahwatukee area.'], 'business_id': 'FYWN1wneV18bWNgQjJ2GNg', 'categories': ['Dentists', 'General Dentistry', 'Health & Medical', 'Oral Surgeons', 'Cosmetic Dentists', 'Orthodontists']}

We are always treated with the utmost respect , and our stylist is awesome.  She is the best we as a family have ever had.  Her color, cut, and advice always makes it a pleasant experience.  And LOVE the products...', 'Amanda was an absolute peach! So sweet and talented too! I\'d never gotten my hair professionally colored before and she did an amazing job! She gave me her expert opinion on "sombr\xc3\xa9" (subtle ombr\xc3\xa9) and I just love it. Never once did I feel rushed and she made me feel right at home. We chatted the whole time (I probably talked her ear off haha I just felt so comfortable and was having a great time!). My cut and color are fantastic and I\'m super happy with it all :) I\'m from Pittsburgh but I currently live in NYC. Regardless, I plan to come back to Amanda for my next cut and my second coloring experience! Highly recommend!!!', 'I specifically requested Stephen as I thought since he owned the business and had been in business for as long as he has, he would be excellent at what he does.  Before washing my hair we discussed what I wanted, which was a simple trim of my current style.  I told him it was important to keep as much length as possible.  I then had my hair washed and sat down for him to cut my hair.  He prepared to make his first cut and had quite a bit of length in his hand.  I asked him if that is what he planned on cutting off and he said yes.  I reminded him that I wanted a trim only and wanted to keep my length.  He then proceeded to tell me he was not going to cut my hair because I would not let him have space to be creative.  He said "I\'ll dry your hair for you though."  Really? How nice of him.  As I left I asked the two women at the front desk if he does that often and they said "sometimes".', "Paid $115.00 for about 8 highlights that dont even look nice. Then she didn't even blow dry my hair nicely. So I spent over a hundred dollars and had to go home and fix my own hair. I will never go back there again.", 'My daughter recently went to have her hair done at Stephen\'s at South Hills Village. During her visit, one of the owners struck up a conversation with her and proceeded to express his unsolicited opinions on her college choices, making comments that were rude, insulting and totally unprofessional. I called the salon to explain what had happened and let them know how upset we were. A manager called me back to pass along that the owner  "said he was sorry".  He did not even have the courtesy to respond to us personally.  I\'ve been a Stephen\'s customer for almost 15 years and I know some great stylists there.  BUT if this is the kind of person that is benefitting from my patronage there - I won\'t be back.', "I have been going to Stephen Szabo Salon for 15+ years and have nothing but great things to say about them.  I have gone to several of the stylists and have enjoyed the Brazilian blowout, different color variations, straightening, etc.  There are many salon options to choose from in the area, but Stephen's is by far the BEST in the South Hills!   Thank you for always taking care of your clients :-)", 'I went here to get my hair done for a wedding with the bridal party. There were 7 girls including the bride...so there were ALOT of us. You would think they would have anticipated that we would need attention and time, but it was utter chaos. It\'s like they hadn\'t known for months we were coming on that particular Saturday morning to get our hair done. It was so rushed and chaotic that none of us, including the bride, enjoyed the experience. \n\nI had even helped them a great deal by straightening my hair beforehand. My hair is really curly and I figured it would be easier to manage and style if I straightened it. I did warn them that I straightened it and not to put any water on it b\\/c the curls would spring up like perennials in Spring. Now to their credit, the woman who was styling my hair didn\'t put any water on it, but she was using hairspray and a curling iron (which I told her may not be necessary) and she made a comment, "wow you weren\'t kidding when you said your hair was curly". b\\/c as she was spraying the hairspray on the "death by fumes" setting and curling the hair (fire hazard anyone?) my hair was holding on to the curls made by the curling iron with such intensity that the hair spray wasn\'t even needed. Umm, did I stutter when I said that my hair is very curly. \n\nPerhaps I\'m being too hard on them, but I had so wanted and expected it to be a good experience (not even great) and I was so disappointed. They didn\'t do anything that I couldn\'t have managed on my own with a curling iron and a large can of Aquanet and a few bobby pins.', "I'm a regular here for many years.
